% load worlds and the drones
1.roslaunch multi_vehicle.launch 

% obtain the position information of drones
2.python3 get_local_pose.py iris 6

% build the communication network among drones
3.bash multi_vehicle_communication.sh

% keyboard control code
4.python3 multirotor_keyboard_control_promotion.py 
% use keyboard to control all drones to take off and press s to hover after a desired height.Then press g to enter leader control mode.

5.bash run_formation_promotion.sh 
%When the script has been launched, then switch to the keyboard control code, pressing f or h can achieve turning in 6 drones formation. Moreover, pressing number 0-9 can change the formation. 

5.bash run_formation_baseline.sh

%Note:
% When the run_formation_promotion script is running and the drones are stationary, switch to the keyboard control terminal to press w to give leader a specified velocity for formation flight. Turning and formation transformation can also be achieved when the drones are running.
% The run_formation_baseline script is for comparison with run_formation_promotion script in performance of running straight line at variable velocity.

% The following script is for plot the information of drones such as error,position and etc.
6.python3 draw_figure.py
