
# Distributed Safe Learning Control -- Policy Training

### Introduction

For this project, you will run the codes in the Matlab environment. The codes verify the convergence condition of actor-critic learning and the closed-stability condition under actor-critic learning in the receding horizon control framework.

### Running the code

- Run `DSLC_two_robots_verification` to verify the convergence condition and the stability condition in the no-obstacle scenario.
- Run `DSLC_two_robots_verification_obstacle` to verify the convergence condition in the obstacle avoidance scenario.
